                <p>
                    The BiCity Project (BiCity) is a collaborative project created and maintained by
                    <ExternalLink url="https://qbquity.com">QBQUITY Sprl</ExternalLink> (we/us), a
                    company based in Belgium (registered office: rue Général Molitor 14 - 1040
                    Brussels). The aim of the project is to offer a service for those who use the
                    bicycle as their main means of transport, giving the possibility to share
                    geo-localized information for each city, region, state. The service is aimed at
                    citizens who use bikes to move around their city but also to those who intend to
                    visit and discover another city or country better using the advice of those who
                    live there and certainly know it better. The information collected and published
                    by the BiCity Project can be of any type, but mainly can include: suggested
                    routes, spare parts shops and bicycle sales, exchange parking lots or
                    bike-friendly services to the citizen to recommend (bars, restaurants, shops in
                    general that offer discounts for cyclists), rescue points or bicycle repair
                    shops, and so on.

                    By using these Services, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of

                        <li>
                            QBQUITY Sprl as host operates the infrastructure and websites (many of
                            which are collaborative Open Source projects), but most of the data are
                            contributed by users. While one of the goals of the BiCity Project is to
                            collect a complete and structured database, BiCity Project does not and
                            cannot proactively review all edits or other contributions. Therefore,
                            we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or
                            reliability of any submitted community content. Suspected data problems

                            procedures.

                            for your edits and contributions, so for your own protection you should
                            exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in
                            criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. Although we may
                            not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that
                            authorities may seek to apply other countries’ laws to you, including
                            local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. QBQUITY

                            liability in the event of third party claims. Furthermore, you
                            acknowledge that QBQUITY Sprl is (and will remain in the future) the
                            owner of the copyright and the sui generis right on the BiCity database.

                <p>
                    We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware of
                    how we collect and use your information. Certain aspects of the Services (e.g.
                    all the activities related to data uploading) require you to have a BiCity
                    account and to be logged into that account while you access those aspects. You
                    agree to keep the contact information associated with your BiCity account
                    current and complete. Your contact information will be used in accordance with
                    the Privacy Policy.

                <p>
                    You must be sixteen (16) years or older to use the Services. If you are under 16
                    years of age but at least 13 years old, a parent or other adult authorized by
                    your parent may create an account for you to use. The account must not contain
                    any personal data about you, and you must not add any personal data about
                    yourself. For example, your parent may create an account using your parent’s
                    email address and a username that is not associated with you, which your parent
                    may permit you to use to contribute map edits. For your protection, you are not
                    allowed to use the social aspects of the Services (diary posts, ‘home’ location,
                    mailing lists and forums), but you may contribute edits to the map. You should
                    not reveal any personal data in any communications you have regarding your map
                    edits. By registering as a user or providing personal information on the
                    Services, you represent that you are at least 16 years old.

                    another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that
                    entity to these Terms, in which case "you" will mean the entity you represent.

                    maintained by the Belgium government. You may not use the Services in any manner
                    that could damage or overburden the Services or interfere with any other party's

                    there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the alternative
                    dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Services. If you
                    seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it
                    exclusively in a court located in Brussels, Belgium. You also agree that Belgian
                    law will govern these Terms, as well as any legal claim that might arise between
                    you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to
                    submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the
                    courts located in Brussels, Belgium, in any legal action or proceeding relating
                    to us or these Terms.

                    is" and "as available" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied
                    warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make
                    no warranty that our Services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure,
                    uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be
                    secure. We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third
                    parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from
                    any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way
                    connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or
                    information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from
                    our Services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. Any
                    material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our Services is
                    done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any
                    damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of
                    any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the
                    deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or
                    communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on
                    use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice. We

                    the Services, including APIs. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or
                    requests you make to the Services are compatible with then-current APIs and
                    authentication methods, and that you handle responses properly. Some states or
                    jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may
                    not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.

                <p>
                    The QBQUITY Sprl will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct,
                    indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but
                    not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other
                    intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of
                    such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand Euro (€
                    1000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the
                    limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the
                    above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will
                    be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

                <p>
                    We may modify these Terms and other terms related to your use of the Services
                    (like our Privacy Policy) from time to time, by posting the changed terms on the
                    BiCity website. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the
                    BiCity website unless they specify a later date. Changes will not apply
                    retroactively. Please check these Terms periodically for changes; your continued
                    use of the Services after new Terms become effective constitutes your binding
                    acceptance of the new Terms.
